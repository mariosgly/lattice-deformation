# Python implementation of B-spline Lattice Deformation (2×2×2)

This repository provides a NumPy and PyTorch implementation of B-spline interpolation using a 2×2×2 lattice structure. The implementation is based on Blender's deformation technique.

## Features
- **Vectorized NumPy Implementation** for efficient CPU-based deformation.
- **PyTorch Implementation** for GPU-accelerated deformation.
- **Example Scripts** demonstrating how to apply deformation to a mesh.
- **Handles 3D Meshes** using Open3D.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bspline-lattice-deformation.git
cd lattice-deformation
pip install -r requirements.txt
